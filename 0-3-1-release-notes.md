# Release Notes v0.3.1

### Minor Updates and Improvements

The v0.3.1 release of the ReFocus app makes the following minor changes and improvements to the application:

##### Migration from non-relational MongoDB to relational Postgres

With Postgres, the development team now can rely on structured relationships within the application's data - allowing them to worry less about the integrity of the core user data behind our application, and more on the important features for our users.

##### Better Settings Notifications

User settings successes and failures will now be more prominently shown at the top of the screen - allowing you, the user, to know your changes have/haven't been made.

###### Better Dashboard Scrolling

If you created a lot of models (which we hope you do!), scrolling in the popup window did not quite work properly. Now you can scroll as far as you need!

##### Model metadata updates show in Model History

When you or someone on your team updates a model's metadata, it will now be logged and shown in the model's history list.

##### Improvements in styling

There have been some minor visual improvements throughout the application, bringing it even closer to a state-of-the-art user experience.
