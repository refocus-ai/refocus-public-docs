## New Model Training Process

ReFocus AI was started with the sole purpose of making machine learning approachable to anyone and anywhere - no matter your technical background.

We are advancing that purpose several steps further with the release of a new model training workflow. 

This workflow now walks you through model creation in smaller bitesized steps so you can better understand how your data and the model are going to deliver your insights.

## New Recommender Dashboard Card

Alongside the Recommender System model option comes an additional dashboard card. This card will show you the top five recommended insights from your Recommender System model train. 

Because ReFocus takes care of all the hard work for you, be sure to check out your dashboard with this new card every day. We make updates and render new predictions on your models every night!

## Bug Fixes and Enhancements

- Training a new model on a data set that other models had been trained on no longer overwrites the previous model's files. 
- Reinforcement learning buttons are more forceful - yes/no information now always submits and is added to the model successfully
- Increased limits on column name character limits
